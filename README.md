Able and result-oriented software engineer with 𝟒+ 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 in .NET technologies and Spring. My expertise includes 𝐂#, 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚, 𝐕𝐁.𝐧𝐞𝐭, and 𝐒𝐐𝐋. I specialize in helping companies create and sustain high quality products with many different modules and well-organized code. 

Some examples of my results include:
  - Developed a scientific product using WinForms for dietitians and sport scientists. The product offers a range of features, including custom reporting, a SQLExpress database, Telerik UI controls, DRI/RDA analysis, and a dynamic way of creating diets.
  - Created Python application for mole image classification to benign or malignant using Convolutional Neural Network with accuracy over 87%. Furthermore having added capabilities like ROI selection and creating the mask of the mole. (Published in IOPScience: Journal of Physics)

I get excited about opportunities where I am able to challenge myself and learn new things. I also enjoy discussing with people new ideas and find the best solutions for problems at hand throughout communication.

Additionally, I am a big fan of MotoGP and I like lifting heavy weights in my free time.
